        <p>So you might wonder what makes Pencil.Gaming so special compared to other gaming libraries, like XNA/MonoGame, OpenTK or SharpDX. There are a number of reasons that Pencil.Gaming is superior to all of the previously mentioned libraries.</p>
        <p>Firstly, you have to understand that I have used XNA and OpenTK in the past, and I don't think these libraries are necessarily terrible, I just think they have some fundamental flaws that Pencil.Gaming manages to resolve.</p>
        <h3>Pencil.Gaming is better than XNA because...</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It's cross-platform</li>
          <li>It's open-source/free</li>
          <li>It's under active development</li>
          <li>The end-user doesn't have to install redistributables</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pencil.Gaming is better than MonoGame because...</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You don't have to feel dirty when using "Microsoft.Xna" namespaces</li>
          <li>It's smaller, and therefore less prone to bugs</li>
          <li>It's not constrained by the development pace of a dead library...</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pencil.Gaming is better than SharpDX because...</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It's cross platform</li>
          <li>And that's a big deal</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pencil.Gaming is better than OpenTK because...</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It's under active development</li>
          <li>Its windowing/input system relies on a well-established, solid, native library</li>
          <li>There's no need for the end-user to install OpenAL</li>
        </ul>
