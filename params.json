{"name":"Pencil.Gaming","tagline":"An open-source, cross-platform gaming library for C# with bindings for OpenGL, OpenAL and GLFW.","body":"Pencil.Gaming is a gaming library for C#, with solid portable OpenGL support imported from OpenTK, nifty math utilities (vectors, matrices ans finally a Tau constant!), most of which are also imported from OpenTK, and solid bindings to OpenAL and GLFW, to ensure maximum cross-platform capabilities.\r\n\r\nAside from binding these native libraries, Pencil.Gaming also has a few utilities, allowing you to easily\r\n- Load WAV files into an OpenAL buffer\r\n- Load images into an OpenGL texture\r\n- Load wavefront models into an OpenGL VBO\r\n\r\n### The wikipedia-user in me says: This game-development related article is a stub.
